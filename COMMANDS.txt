Commands for using the Beertimer bot: (assuming your prefix is '-'; you can change that in the auth.json config file):

-timer			Bot not started: tells you the current intervall
			Bot started: tells you the time until the next alert
-timer set <time>	Set the intervall for the alert, minimum is 30 seconds
			Example: 	Set interval to 1 minute: -timer set 5m
					Set interval to 45 seconds: -timer set 45
			(TODO: combination of minutes and seconds)
-start			Start the timer
			if the user that sent the command is in a voice channel, the bot will also try to join that voice channel
			it will always send text alerts in the text channel that the start command was from (TODO: cmd to turn off text / voice alerts)
-stop			Stops the bot; it will also leave the voice channel if it is connected to one
